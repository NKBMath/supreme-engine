    <h3>1. Independent Research</h3>
    <h4>The Superposition Principle and the Riemann Hypothesis: A New Perspective on a Classic Problem</h4>
    <p>
        This work explores a novel function, <em>G(s)</em>, defined through prime numbers, which directly connects the distribution of primes and the non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function.
        Through mathematical theorems and properties, the paper introduces a wave interference perspective to analyze the symmetry and cancellations in the Riemann zeta function.
        The research provides insights into fractal-like structures of critical zeros and their implications for proving the Riemann Hypothesis.

    <h4>Unified Framework for Total Variation Regularized Optimization in Fluid Dynamics and Related Physical Systems</h4>
    <p>
        This project presents an optimization framework for minimizing the energy functional governing physical systems such as fluid dynamics, particle transport, and phase transitions. 
        The method introduces a Total Variation (TV) regularization term to analyze convergence in convection-dominated problems, and its application is demonstrated across systems like 
        the Navier-Stokes, Boltzmann, and Maxwell equations.

    <h4>Modular Forms in Combinatorial Optimization</h4>
    <p>
        This paper introduces a theoretical framework for applying modular forms to combinatorial optimization problems, with a focus on the Asymmetric Traveling Salesman Problem (ATSP). 
        By translating the problem into the complex domain, the research uncovers a modular structure and leverages modular invariance to inform both unconstrained and constrained optimal solutions.
        The findings lay a foundation for future algorithmic development at the intersection of number theory and combinatorial optimization.

    <h4>Stochastic Optimization Using Ricci Flow</h4>
    <p>
        This paper proposes a novel theoretical framework for optimizing bounded functions using Fourier series approximations and Ricci flow. The approach combines sampling methods along circles defined 
        by Riemannian metrics with "inverse Ricci flow" to identify potential global optima through the accentuation of high curvature regions. The technique is applicable to a variety of optimization problems, 
        offering insights into high-dimensional and non-convex landscapes.

 <h3>2. Ph.D. Research</h3>
    <h4>Topological Data Analysis, AI-Driven Predictive Modeling, Mathematical Modeling, and Optimization of Agrivoltaic Systems</h4>
    <p>
        My Ph.D. research focuses on integrating advanced mathematical modeling, AI-driven predictive analytics, 
        and topological data analysis to optimize agrivoltaic systems. By combining theoretical insights with practical applications, 
        this work offers transformative solutions for sustainable farming and renewable energy integration.
    </p>

    <h5>Thermal Analysis of Agrivoltaic Systems</h5>
    <p>
        This study models the spatiotemporal energy distribution in agrivoltaic fields, focusing on the thermal gradients induced 
        by panel shading. Insights into the geometric distribution of energy flux reveal patterns critical to optimizing plant growth 
        and energy output. Thermal anomalies driven by shadow effects form a basis for system-wide temperature modeling.
    </p>

    <h5>Bijection Between Tracking Algorithms and Shadow Distribution </h5>
    <p>
        This chapter mathematically proves a bijection between tracking algorithms and spatiotemporal shadow distributions, 
        connecting these dynamics to toroidal symmetry. The uniqueness of shadow profiles, as derived, enables precise optimization 
        of tracking systems for agrivoltaic applications.
    </p>

    <h5>Mathematical Framework for Plant Growth Dynamics </h5>
    <p>
        By integrating crop models with spatiotemporal radiation patterns, this work introduces a novel framework for plant growth 
        dynamics. The findings demonstrate the non-monotonic relationship between crop yield and total radiation, emphasizing 
        nonlinear interactions shaped by shading and photosynthesis.
    </p>

    <h5>Predicting Corn Yield Using Hybrid AI Models </h5>
    <p>
        A hybrid LSTM-Transformer model was developed to predict corn yield by integrating spatiotemporal shadow geometry with 
        machine learning techniques. The model captures both short- and long-term radiation impacts, enhancing predictive accuracy 
        and informing agrivoltaic design.
    </p>

    <h5>Economic Optimization of Corn Agrivoltaic Farming </h5>
    <p>
        Using iso-profit curves, this research identifies optimal economic configurations for agrivoltaic systems. Spatial layout 
        optimization combines geometric shadow analysis with profitability metrics to guide decisions on panel spacing, height, 
        and tracking algorithms.
